# Data Export Guide

This guide explains how to download survey data from Census, including who can download, when downloads are available, and what security measures are in place.

## Prerequisites

Before you can download survey data:

1. **Survey must be closed** - Data export is only available after the survey has been formally closed
2. **You must have appropriate permissions** - See [Access Control](#who-can-download-data) below
3. **Survey must have responses** - Empty surveys cannot be exported

## Who Can Download Data

Access to data exports is strictly controlled based on your role:

### Survey Creators
- Can download data from **their own surveys only**
- Must be the original creator or have had ownership transferred to them
- Can extend retention for their own surveys

### Organization Owners
- Can download data from **all surveys in their organization**
- Can extend retention for any survey in the organization
- Can designate data custodians
- Receive notifications for all data downloads in the organization

### Data Custodians (Optional Role)
- Can download data from **assigned surveys only**
- Cannot edit the survey
- Cannot extend retention periods
- Useful for delegating data management without giving full edit access

### Editors and Viewers
- **Cannot download data** - No access to exports
- Can only view or edit survey structure (if editor)
- For data access, they must request the survey creator or organization owner to download on their behalf

## When Can I Download Data?

### After Survey Closure

Data export becomes available when a survey is **closed**:

1. Go to your survey dashboard
2. Click "Close Survey" button
3. Confirm closure (this cannot be undone)
4. The "Download Data" button will appear

**What happens when a survey closes:**
- All responses are locked (no further edits possible)
- Data export functionality is enabled
- 6-month retention period begins
- Automatic deletion warnings are scheduled

### Time Window

Once a survey is closed, data can be downloaded:
- For the **default 6-month retention period**
- Up to **24 months** if retention is extended
- Until **automatic deletion** occurs (after warnings)
- Unless a **legal hold** is placed (prevents deletion)

## How to Download Data

### Step 1: Navigate to Survey

**From Survey List (Organization Owners):**
1. Go to "Surveys" in the main navigation
2. Find the closed survey in your list
3. Click the "Download Data" button next to the survey

**From Survey Dashboard (Creators/Custodians):**
1. Open your survey
2. Go to the "Data" or "Dashboard" tab
3. Click the "Download Data" button

### Step 2: Accept Disclaimer

Before downloading, you must accept the data responsibility disclaimer:

**You will be asked to confirm:**

**You must provide:**

- Purpose of download (brief description)
- Confirmation that you have authority to download this data

**Important:** Making false statements in the disclaimer may violate data protection laws and your employment contract.

### Step 3: Receive Download Link

After accepting the disclaimer:

1. A secure download link is generated
2. The link expires in **15 minutes** (for security)
3. The link can be used **only once**
4. An email is sent to all organization administrators about the download

### Step 4: Download the File

Click the download link to receive a **password-protected ZIP file** containing:

**Files in the ZIP:**
- `survey_data.csv` - The encrypted survey responses
- `metadata.json` - Export information (timestamp, user, version)
- `README.txt` - Instructions for using the data

**File Protection:**
- ZIP file is password-protected
- Password is shown on-screen (not emailed for security)
- CSV inside is also encrypted
- You must save the password securely

### Step 5: Extract and Use Data

1. Extract the ZIP file using the provided password
2. Open `survey_data.csv` in Excel, R, Python, or your preferred tool
3. Review `metadata.json` for export details
4. Read `README.txt` for data dictionary and notes

## Data Format

### CSV Structure

The exported CSV file contains:

**Standard Columns:**
- `response_id` - Unique identifier for this response
- `submitted_at` - Date and time response was submitted
- `user_id` - Anonymized user identifier (if logged in)
- `status` - Response status (complete, partial, etc.)

**Question Columns:**
- Each question becomes a column
- Column names use question slugs (e.g., `patient_age`, `hospital_name`)
- Multi-choice questions may span multiple columns

**Metadata Columns:**

### Encrypted Fields

Some fields may be encrypted in the CSV:
- Email addresses
- Phone numbers
- Other personally identifiable information (PII)

**To decrypt:**
- Use the decryption key provided in `metadata.json`
- Or contact your organization administrator
- Decryption requires appropriate permissions

## Security Measures

### Password Protection

Every download is protected by:
- **ZIP password** - Generated randomly, shown once
- **Encryption** - CSV data encrypted with survey key
- **Time-limited link** - Expires in 15 minutes
- **Single-use link** - Cannot be reused after download

### Audit Logging

Every download is logged with:
- User who downloaded (name, email, user ID)
- Timestamp (date and time)
- IP address
- Survey downloaded
- Purpose stated
- Attestation accepted

### Email Notifications

When data is downloaded:
- **Organization administrators** receive immediate email
- Email includes: who, what, when, why
- Links to audit log for full details

### Access Tracking

You can view download history:
1. Go to survey dashboard
2. Click "Download History" tab
3. See all past downloads with details

## Download Limits

To prevent abuse:
- **Maximum 5 downloads per survey per day** per user
- **Excessive attempts** are logged and may be blocked
- **Rate limiting** applies to prevent automated downloads

If you need more downloads, contact your organization administrator.

## Troubleshooting

### "Download Data" Button Not Visible

**Possible causes:**
- Survey is not yet closed → Close the survey first
- You don't have permission → Check your role
- Survey has no responses → Nothing to download
- Survey is deleted → Cannot download from deleted surveys

### Download Link Expired

**If your link expires:**
- Click "Download Data" again to generate a new link
- You must accept the disclaimer again (for audit trail)
- Previous link cannot be extended or reused

### Password Doesn't Work

**If ZIP password fails:**
- Copy and paste carefully (no extra spaces)
- Check for case sensitivity
- Regenerate the download (creates new password)
- Contact support if problem persists

### File Won't Open

**If CSV file won't open:**
- Ensure you extracted the ZIP first
- Try different software (Excel, Google Sheets, etc.)
- Check file encoding (UTF-8)
- Contact your organization administrator

### "Permission Denied" Error

**You may not have permission because:**
- You're an Editor or Viewer (not Creator/Owner/Custodian)
- You're not the survey creator (and not an org owner)
- You're not in the organization that owns the survey
- Your account has been deactivated

Contact your organization owner to request access.

### Data Handling
