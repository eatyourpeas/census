# Documentation

CheckTick is an open source project for clinicians to run surveys, audits or research, especially in the UK.

The average clinician in the NHS has plenty of research ideas, quality improvement or audit project opportunities, but most will not have any departmental money to spend on carrying them out. If any of these involve running a survey that involves patients, the only platforms that can host them sit within Universities and are out of reach for the average person running a small project in their spare time.

For clinicians doing surveys or questionnaires that don't involve sensitive patient data, still the available solutions are not tailored to health care.

CheckTick meets all these needs. It allows users to build their own questions from a range of question types, including a range of prebuilt question groups. For example, if you are surveying doctors and you want to know where they work, you can use the Professional Details question group - fields prepopulated with all the hosital trusts in the UK. Interested in index of multiple deprivation in your patients? This calculation is built in and is run against any valid UK postcode.

In addition to the platform, there is an API. All the same endpoints can be accessed this way. In both cases security is tight, with logging, and a range of safeguards to lock down access. There is a full range of tests to support this.

This documentation should answer questions you may have as a user, but also covers particular those aspects where you are looking to host CheckTick yourself. It is deliberately customisable, so you can change the styles and themes, or the email server you use.
