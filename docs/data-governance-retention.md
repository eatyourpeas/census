# Data Retention Policy

This guide explains how long survey data is kept in Census, when it will be deleted, how to extend retention periods, and what happens during deletion.

## Overview

Census follows a **time-limited storage** principle:
- Survey data is **not kept indefinitely**
- Retention periods are **clearly defined** and **enforced automatically**
- Users receive **multiple warnings** before deletion
- Deletion is **permanent and cannot be undone**

This policy balances the need for data access with data protection obligations and storage efficiency.

## Default Retention Period

### When Retention Begins

The retention period starts when a survey is **closed**:

**Before Closure:**
- Responses are being collected
- No retention period applies
- Data is kept until survey is closed
- Survey can be edited and reopened

**After Closure:**
- Survey is locked (no new responses)
- 6-month retention period begins
- Countdown to deletion starts
- Warnings are scheduled

### Standard Period

**Default: 6 months** from survey closure

This is sufficient time for:
- Analyzing results
- Writing reports
- Publishing findings
- Archiving important data elsewhere

**Example timeline:**
- Survey closed: January 1, 2025
- Retention period: 6 months
- First warning: June 1, 2025 (1 month remaining)
- Final warning: June 24, 2025 (1 week remaining)
- Last chance: June 30, 2025 (1 day remaining)
- Automatic deletion: July 1, 2025

## Extended Retention

### Maximum Period

You can extend retention up to **24 months** (2 years) from closure.

**Why the limit?**
- Minimizes data protection risks
- Reduces storage costs
- Encourages timely analysis
- Complies with data minimization principles

### Who Can Extend

**Survey Creators:**
- Can extend retention for **their own surveys**
- Each survey treated separately
- No organization-wide permissions needed

**Organization Owners:**
- Can extend retention for **any survey in the organization**
- Can set organization-wide policies
- Receive warnings for all surveys

**Data Custodians:**
- **Cannot extend retention** - Read-only access
- Must ask survey creator or organization owner

**Editors/Viewers:**
- **Cannot extend retention** - No data access

### How to Extend Retention

**Step 1: Receive Warning**

You'll receive emails at:
- **1 month** before deletion
- **1 week** before deletion
- **1 day** before deletion

Each email contains a link to extend retention.

**Step 2: Navigate to Survey**

1. Go to the survey dashboard
2. Look for the "Data Retention" section
3. Check current expiry date
4. See remaining time

**Step 3: Request Extension**

Click "Extend Retention Period" and choose:
- **3 months** - Short-term extension
- **6 months** - Standard extension
- **12 months** - Long-term extension
- **Custom** - Up to 24 months total

**Step 4: Provide Justification**

You must explain why you need more time:

**Valid reasons:**
- Ongoing analysis
- Publication pending
- Legal proceedings
- Audit requirements
- Research project timeline

**Invalid reasons:**
- "Just in case"
- "Might need it later"
- No specific purpose
- Convenience

**Step 5: Confirm Extension**

- New expiry date is calculated
- Extension is logged for audit trail
- New warning schedule is created
- All relevant users are notified

### Extension Limits

**Per Survey:**
- **Maximum total retention:** 24 months from closure
- **Number of extensions:** Unlimited (within 24-month limit)
- **Minimum extension:** 1 month
- **Maximum single extension:** 12 months

**Example:**
- Survey closed: January 1, 2025
- Initial retention: 6 months (expires July 1, 2025)
- First extension: +6 months (expires January 1, 2026)
- Second extension: +6 months (expires July 1, 2026)
- Third extension: +6 months ‚ùå **Denied** - Would exceed 24 months
- Maximum possible expiry: January 1, 2027 (24 months from closure)

## Deletion Warnings

## Deletion Process

### Soft Deletion (30-Day Grace Period)

When the retention period expires:

**Day 0 (Deletion Date):**
- Survey data is **soft deleted**
- No longer accessible in the UI
- Marked for permanent deletion
- 30-day grace period begins

**Grace Period (Days 1-30):**
- Data still exists in database
- **Can be recovered** by administrators
- Not visible to users
- Backups still include the data

**Purpose of Grace Period:**
- Protects against accidental deletion
- Allows for "oops" moments
- Organization owner can restore if needed

### Recovery During Grace Period

**Who Can Recover:**
- **Organization owners** only
- System administrators (on request)

**How to Recover:**

1. Contact your organization owner
2. Explain why recovery is needed
3. Organization owner accesses "Deleted Surveys"
4. Clicks "Restore" next to the survey
5. Survey data is restored with new retention period
6. Must provide justification for audit trail

**Limitations:**
- **Must be within 30 days** of soft deletion
- **Cannot exceed 24-month total limit** from original closure
- **Recovery is logged** and reported

### Hard Deletion (Permanent)

**After 30 days:**
- Survey data is **hard deleted**
- **Completely removed** from database
- **Backups are purged**
- **Cannot be recovered** by anyone
- **Deletion is logged** for compliance

**What is Deleted:**
- All survey responses
- Personally identifiable information (PII)
- Export history (summary retained for audit)
- Attachments and uploaded files
- Associated metadata

**What is Retained:**
- Survey structure (questions, groups)
- Audit log summary (who, when, not data content)
- Aggregated statistics (if anonymized)
- Download history (who downloaded, when, not data)

## Special Cases

### Legal Holds

**What is a Legal Hold?**
- Prevents automatic deletion
- Used during legal proceedings, investigations, or audits
- Overrides retention period
- Requires documented reason

**Who Can Place Legal Holds:**
- **Organization owners only**
- Must provide justification
- Cannot be applied retroactively to hard-deleted data

**Effect:**
- Deletion warnings stop
- Retention period frozen
- Data export still available
- Survey remains closed

**Removing Legal Holds:**
- Organization owner must remove explicitly
- New retention period begins after removal
- Standard warning schedule resumes

**See:** [Special Cases Guide](/docs/data-governance-special-cases/) for details

### Ownership Transfer

**What happens when survey creator leaves?**

If the creator is removed from the organization:
- **Ownership transfers** to organization owner
- Retention settings **remain unchanged**
- Organization owner receives future warnings
- Data custodians remain assigned (if any)

**See:** [Special Cases Guide](/docs/data-governance-special-cases/) for details

### Organization Deletion

**What happens when an organization is deleted?**

- All surveys in the organization are **immediately soft deleted**
- **30-day grace period** applies
- Organization owner receives final email
- After 30 days: **All data hard deleted**

## Retention Best Practices

### Plan Ahead

- **Download early** - Don't wait for warnings
- **Set calendar reminders** - Track important expiry dates
- **Archive externally** - Move data to long-term storage if needed
- **Extend proactively** - Don't rely on last-minute extensions

### Be Realistic

- **Don't over-extend** - Only keep data you actually need
- **Justify extensions** - Have clear, specific reasons
- **Review periodically** - Reassess if you still need the data
- **Delete when done** - Reduce risk and storage costs

### Follow Policy

- **Respect the 24-month limit** - It exists for good reasons
- **Provide honest justifications** - Don't make up reasons
- **Don't hoard data** - "Just in case" is not sufficient
- **Document your decisions** - Keep notes on why you extended

### Security

- **Download before deletion** - Export critical data
- **Encrypt downloads** - Use password-protected files
- **Delete local copies** - When no longer needed
- **Follow data policy** - See [Data Policy](/docs/data-governance-policy/)

## Troubleshooting

### Didn't Receive Warnings

**Check:**
- Email address is correct in your profile
- Warnings not in spam folder
- You have appropriate role (Creator/Owner/Custodian)
- Email notifications enabled in settings

**Fix:**
- Update your email address
- Check spam filters
- Contact organization owner
- Enable notifications

### Warning Says "Cannot Extend"

**Possible reasons:**
- Already at 24-month maximum
- Survey has legal hold (cannot extend, already protected)
- You don't have permission (not Creator or Owner)
- Survey already deleted

### Accidentally Deleted

**Within 30 days:**
- Contact organization owner immediately
- Request recovery
- Explain situation
- Provide justification

**After 30 days:**
- **Cannot be recovered**
- Data is permanently gone
- Learn from the experience
- Improve processes to prevent recurrence

### Extension Request Rejected

**Organization policies may:**
- Limit maximum retention
- Require approval for extensions over certain length
- Prohibit extensions without strong justification
- Require data protection impact assessment

**Contact your organization owner** to understand policy.

## Compliance and Legal

### Data Minimization

This policy implements the **data minimization principle** (GDPR Article 5):
- Data kept only as long as necessary
- Automatic deletion reduces risk
- Clear retention periods
- Justification required for extensions

### Right to Erasure

Participants may request deletion under "right to be forgotten" (GDPR Article 17):
- Deletion supersedes retention policy
- Must be actioned within 30 days
- Survey responses are removed immediately
- Audit trail retained (anonymized)

### Accountability

This policy ensures **accountability** (GDPR Article 5):
- All retention decisions are logged
- Justifications required and retained
- Audit trail for compliance demonstration
- Regular review of retention practices
