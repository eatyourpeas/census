# Data Security Guide

This guide explains security best practices for handling survey data downloaded from CheckTick, your responsibilities as a data handler, and what to do if something goes wrong.

## Your Responsibility

When you download survey data, **you become responsible** for protecting it. This includes:

- Storing data securely
- Preventing unauthorized access
- Following data protection laws
- Reporting breaches immediately
- Deleting data when no longer needed

**Important:** You can be held personally liable for data breaches if you fail to follow security practices.

## Before You Download

### Check Your Authority

Before downloading data, verify:

- ✓ You have a **legitimate purpose** for accessing the data
- ✓ You have **appropriate permissions** (Creator/Owner/Custodian)
- ✓ Downloading is **necessary** - Can you work with anonymized/aggregated data instead?
- ✓ You have **approval** from your organization (if required)
- ✓ You understand **your obligations** under data protection laws

### Prepare Your Environment

Ensure your device is secure:

- ✓ **Work device only** - Never use personal computers
- ✓ **Full disk encryption** enabled (FileVault on macOS, BitLocker on Windows)
- ✓ **Strong password** - At least 12 characters, unique
- ✓ **Up-to-date software** - Operating system and security patches current
- ✓ **Antivirus/antimalware** - Running and updated
- ✓ **Firewall** - Enabled and properly configured
- ✓ **Screen lock** - Automatic after 5 minutes of inactivity

### Check Your Network

Download only over secure networks:

- ✓ **Organizational network** - Work VPN or office network
- ✗ **Public WiFi** - Never use coffee shops, airports, hotels
- ✗ **Home network** - Avoid unless it meets organizational security standards
- ✗ **Mobile hotspot** - Avoid unless encrypted and from work device

## During Download

### Secure Download Process

Follow these steps when downloading:

1. **Verify the URL** - Ensure you're on the genuine CheckTick site
2. **Accept disclaimer** - Read and understand your obligations
3. **Save password securely** - Use password manager, never write it down
4. **Download to encrypted location** - Work drive, not Downloads folder
5. **Verify download** - Check file size and integrity
6. **Delete browser history** - Clear download history after saving

### Password Management

The ZIP password is critical:

- ✓ **Use password manager** - LastPass, 1Password, Bitwarden, etc.
- ✓ **Copy carefully** - No typos, no extra spaces
- ✓ **Save immediately** - Before closing the download page
- ✗ **Never email** - Even to yourself
- ✗ **Never write down** - Not on paper, sticky notes, or text files
- ✗ **Never share** - Except with authorized colleagues via secure method

### Immediate Actions

After downloading:

1. **Move to secure location** - Encrypted folder on work drive
2. **Extract the ZIP** - In the same secure location
3. **Delete ZIP file** - Keep only extracted files
4. **Verify contents** - Check all expected files are present
5. **Set file permissions** - Restrict to only yourself
6. **Close download link** - Clear from browser

## Storing Data Securely

### Location Requirements

Store downloaded data:

**Approved Locations:**
- ✓ Encrypted work device hard drive
- ✓ Organization-managed network drive (if encrypted)
- ✓ Organization-approved secure cloud (e.g., Azure with encryption)
- ✓ Secure server with access controls

**Prohibited Locations:**
- ✗ USB drives or external hard drives
- ✗ Personal cloud storage (Dropbox, Google Drive, iCloud, OneDrive personal)
- ✗ Personal email attachments
- ✗ Unencrypted network shares
- ✗ Shared drives without access controls
- ✗ Personal devices (laptops, phones, tablets)
- ✗ Physical printouts (unless absolutely necessary and secured)

### File Organization

Organize files securely:

**Folder Structure:**
```text
/secure_work_folder/
  └── census_data/
      ├── 2025/
      │   ├── survey_12345/
      │   │   ├── survey_data.csv
      │   │   ├── metadata.json
      │   │   └── README.txt
      │   └── survey_67890/
      └── archive/
```

**Best Practices:**
- Use descriptive folder names (but avoid PII in folder names)
- Keep different surveys separate
- Archive old data separately
- Delete entire folder structure when done

### File Permissions

Set strict permissions:

**On Windows:**
1. Right-click file/folder → Properties → Security
2. Remove "Everyone" and "Users" groups
3. Keep only your user account
4. Set to "Full Control" for you only

**On macOS:**
1. Right-click file/folder → Get Info → Sharing & Permissions
2. Remove "everyone" and "staff"
3. Keep only your user account
4. Set to "Read & Write" for you only

**On Linux:**
```bash
chmod 600 survey_data.csv  # Read/write for owner only
chmod 700 census_data/     # Full access for owner only
```

### Encryption

Layer encryption for maximum security:

**Level 1: Full Disk Encryption**
- Already provided by FileVault/BitLocker
- Protects if device is stolen

**Level 2: Folder Encryption**
- Use VeraCrypt or similar to create encrypted container
- Protects even if device is accessed while running

**Level 3: File Encryption**
- CSV files can be encrypted with tools like GPG
- Protects if file is copied elsewhere

**Recommended:** At minimum, use Levels 1 and 2.

## Using Data Securely

### Working with Data

When analyzing data:

- ✓ **Close door/curtains** - Prevent shoulder surfing
- ✓ **Privacy screen filter** - On your monitor
- ✓ **Lock screen** - When leaving desk, even briefly
- ✓ **Minimize windows** - When not actively using
- ✓ **Use secure viewer** - Excel/R/Python with data at rest encryption
- ✗ **Never screen share** - Without ensuring no sensitive data visible
- ✗ **Never present** - With raw data on screen in public spaces

### Sharing Within Your Organization

If you must share data with colleagues:

**Approved Methods:**
- ✓ Secure file share (organization-approved)
- ✓ Encrypted email (if organization supports it)
- ✓ Hand delivery on encrypted USB (if policy allows)
- ✓ Through CheckTick itself (add them as data custodian)

**Prohibited Methods:**
- ✗ Unencrypted email
- ✗ Personal email (Gmail, Yahoo, etc.)
- ✗ Cloud sharing links (Dropbox, Google Drive, WeTransfer, etc.)
- ✗ Instant messaging (Slack, Teams, WhatsApp, etc.)
- ✗ Social media
- ✗ Physical printouts left unsecured

**Before Sharing:**
1. Verify recipient has legitimate need
2. Confirm they have appropriate permissions
3. Use password-protected ZIP (new password, shared separately)
4. Notify via separate channel (e.g., phone call)
5. Log the share in your own records

### Sharing Outside Your Organization

**Generally prohibited** without specific approval.

**If absolutely necessary:**
1. Get written approval from organization owner
2. Ensure data sharing agreement is signed
3. Anonymize/pseudonymize data if possible
4. Use secure transfer method
5. Log the transfer
6. Audit recipient's security practices

## Deleting Data Securely

### When to Delete

Delete data when:

- ✓ Analysis is complete
- ✓ Report is published
- ✓ No longer needed for stated purpose
- ✓ Retention period expires
- ✓ Participant requests deletion (right to erasure)
- ✓ You leave the organization
- ✓ Project is cancelled

**Don't keep data "just in case"** - This violates data minimization principles.

### Secure Deletion Methods

**Simple Delete (Not Sufficient):**
- Moving to Trash/Recycle Bin does not delete
- Standard "Empty Trash" can be recovered
- Not acceptable for sensitive data

**Secure File Deletion:**

**On Windows:**
- Use SDelete from Microsoft Sysinternals
- Or: `cipher /w:C:\folder` (built-in)

**On macOS:**
- Use `srm` command (if available)
- Or: Disk Utility → Erase Free Space → "Most Secure"

**On Linux:**
- Use `shred -vfz -n 10 survey_data.csv`
- Or: `wipe -rfq census_data/`

**In Python (for programmatic deletion):**
```python
import os
import random

def secure_delete(file_path, passes=7):
    with open(file_path, "ba+") as f:
        length = f.tell()
        for _ in range(passes):
            f.seek(0)
            f.write(os.urandom(length))
    os.remove(file_path)
```

### Verify Deletion

After secure deletion:

1. **Check Trash/Recycle Bin** - Should be empty
2. **Search for file** - Should not be found
3. **Check backups** - Ensure backups are also purged (if you control them)
4. **Document deletion** - Log date and method in your records

### Cloud Storage Deletion

If data was stored in cloud:

1. Delete from cloud storage
2. Empty cloud trash/recycle bin
3. Check "version history" - Delete all versions
4. Verify deletion in cloud provider's audit log
5. Contact provider if permanent deletion needed (some providers retain deleted data)

## Data Breach Response

### What Counts as a Breach?

A data breach includes:

- Unauthorized access to data
- Accidental email to wrong person
- Lost or stolen device containing data
- Ransomware/malware infection on device with data
- Unauthorized copying or sharing
- Data left unattended in public space
- Improper disposal (e.g., not securely deleted)

**Even small breaches must be reported.**

### Immediate Actions (Within Minutes)

If you suspect a breach:

1. **Stop** - Don't make it worse (e.g., don't forward the email again)
2. **Contain** - Disconnect device from network if infected
3. **Preserve evidence** - Don't delete logs or emails
4. **Notify immediately** - Contact organization owner and Data Protection Officer

**Call, don't email** - Breaches are urgent.

### Reporting Requirements

**Within 1 hour:**
- Notify your organization owner
- Notify Data Protection Officer (if your organization has one)
- Notify IT security team

**Within 24 hours:**
- Provide written incident report:
  - What happened
  - When it happened
  - What data was affected (how many records, what type)
  - Who may have accessed the data
  - What you've done to contain it

**Within 72 hours (if required by law):**
- Your organization must report to regulatory authority (ICO in UK, etc.)
- You must cooperate fully with investigation

### What NOT to Do

During a breach:

- ✗ **Don't hide it** - Covering up makes legal consequences worse
- ✗ **Don't try to "fix" it yourself** - You may destroy evidence
- ✗ **Don't contact affected individuals** - Organization will handle this
- ✗ **Don't discuss publicly** - Including social media
- ✗ **Don't delete anything** - Even if you think it helps

### Consequences

Data breaches can result in:

- **Personal liability** - Fines up to £17 million or 4% of organizational turnover (GDPR)
- **Disciplinary action** - Up to and including termination
- **Criminal prosecution** - In serious cases
- **Professional sanctions** - Loss of licenses/certifications
- **Civil lawsuits** - From affected individuals
- **Reputational damage** - Both personal and organizational

**This is serious.** Follow security practices carefully.
