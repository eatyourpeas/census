# Data Governance Overview

CheckTick takes data protection and governance seriously. This guide explains how we handle your survey data, who can access it, and your responsibilities as a data custodian.

## What is Data Governance?

Data governance is the framework that ensures survey data is:
- **Secure** - Protected from unauthorized access
- **Compliant** - Meets legal and regulatory requirements
- **Controlled** - Only accessible to authorized people
- **Time-limited** - Not kept longer than necessary
- **Audited** - All access is logged and traceable

## Why Does It Matter?

When you collect survey data, especially in healthcare, you may be handling sensitive or personal information. Good data governance protects:
- **Participants** - Their privacy and confidentiality
- **Your organization** - From data breaches and compliance violations
- **You** - From legal liability and reputational damage

## Key Principles

### 1. Access Control

Not everyone can access survey data. Access is strictly controlled based on roles:

| Role | Can View Responses | Can Download Data | Can Extend Retention |
|------|-------------------|-------------------|---------------------|
| **Survey Creator** | ✅ Own surveys | ✅ Own surveys | ✅ Own surveys |
| **Organization Owner** | ✅ All org surveys | ✅ All org surveys | ✅ All org surveys |
| **Data Custodian*** | ❌ No | ✅ Assigned surveys | ❌ No |
| **Editor** | ❌ No | ❌ No | ❌ No |
| **Viewer** | ❌ No | ❌ No | ❌ No |

\* *Optional role - can be assigned per survey for data management delegation*

### 2. Survey Closure

Data can only be downloaded after a survey has been formally **closed**. Closing a survey:
- Locks all responses (no further edits)
- Enables data export functionality
- Starts the retention countdown
- Triggers automatic deletion warnings

This ensures data is only extracted when collection is complete.

### 3. Time-Limited Storage

Survey data is **not kept indefinitely**. By default:
- Data is kept for **6 months** after survey closure
- You receive warnings at **1 month**, **1 week**, and **1 day** before deletion
- Data is automatically deleted unless you extend retention
- Maximum retention period is **24 months**

### 4. Audit Trail

Every data access is logged:
- Who downloaded data
- When they downloaded it
- What survey data was downloaded
- Their stated purpose
- Their IP address

Organization administrators receive email notifications for all data downloads.

### 5. User Responsibility

When you download data, you become responsible for:
- Storing it securely (encrypted, password-protected location)
- Not sharing it inappropriately
- Deleting it when no longer needed
- Reporting any data breaches
- Complying with your organization's data policies

## Data Lifecycle

```

## Special Cases

### Legal Holds

In rare cases, a **legal hold** may be placed on survey data:
- Prevents automatic deletion
- Applied by organization owners or administrators
- Requires a documented reason
- Used when data is subject to legal proceedings or investigations
- All legal holds are logged and audited

### Ownership Transfer

If a survey creator leaves the organization:
- Survey ownership automatically transfers to the organization owner
- All permissions and access rights are maintained
- Both parties are notified via email
- Audit trail records the transfer

### Data Custodian Role

Organizations can designate a **Data Custodian** for specific surveys:
- Can download data but cannot edit the survey
- Useful for delegating data management
- Receives deletion warning emails
- Does not have permission to extend retention
- Optional - not required for every survey

## Your Responsibilities

### As a Survey Creator
- Close surveys promptly when data collection is complete
- Download data only when necessary
- Store downloaded data securely
- Delete local copies when no longer needed
- Respond to deletion warnings before deadlines
- Justify any retention extensions

### As an Organization Owner
- Set clear data policies for your organization
- Monitor data downloads across all surveys
- Review retention extensions
- Ensure appropriate access controls
- Designate data custodians when appropriate
- Respond to legal hold requests

### As a Data Custodian
- Download data only when authorized
- Follow your organization's data handling procedures
- Store exports securely
- Report any security concerns immediately
- Maintain confidentiality
