- **Date removed:** {{ removed_date }}
- **Original hold placed:** {{ hold_placed_date }}
- **Duration:** {{ hold_duration }}

{{ reason }}

## What This Means

✅ **Normal data governance has resumed**

The survey is no longer subject to legal preservation requirements:

- Automatic deletion schedule has resumed
- Normal retention policies apply
- You can manage data per usual procedures
- Deletion warnings will be sent as scheduled

## Updated Deletion Schedule

{% if survey.deletion_date %}
**New scheduled deletion date:** {{ new_deletion_date }}

You will receive deletion warning emails:

- 30 days before deletion
- 7 days before deletion
- 1 day before deletion

{% else %}
The survey is still open. Once closed, data will be retained for {{ survey.retention_months }} months before deletion.
{% endif %}

## What You Should Do

### Review Data Needs

Now that the legal hold is lifted, assess whether you still need this data:

1. **Do you still need the data?**

   - If yes: Take no action, wait for deletion warnings
   - If no: Consider exporting and then deleting the survey

2. **Does retention period need adjustment?**
   - Current retention: {{ survey.retention_months }} months
   - You can extend up to 24 months total if needed
   - Provide justification for extensions

### Manage Local Copies

If you have local copies of this survey data:

- **Review security**: Ensure exports are still stored securely
- **Assess need**: Do you still need these local copies?
- **Delete if done**: Securely delete local copies if no longer needed
- **Document retention**: If keeping data, document why

### Update Access

Review and update data access as needed:

- Remove custodian access for anyone who no longer needs it
- Update permissions to reflect current requirements
- Ensure only authorized users can access the data

## Return to Normal Governance

With the legal hold removed, you are back to normal data governance:

✅ **Retention limits apply**: Maximum 24 months from closure  
✅ **Justification required**: Extensions need documented reasons  
✅ **Automatic deletion**: Survey will be deleted at end of retention  
✅ **Audit logging**: All actions are logged for compliance

## Your Ongoing Responsibilities

Continue to:

- **Protect the data**: Maintain appropriate security measures
- **Minimize retention**: Don't keep data longer than necessary
- **Respond to warnings**: Act on deletion warning emails
- **Stay compliant**: Follow data protection regulations
- **Document decisions**: Keep records of retention extensions
