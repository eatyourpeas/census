	be expressed via Tailwind utilities, DaisyUI components, or minimal
	overrides here. The build outputs to:
		static/build/styles.css (see package.json scripts)

	Avoid creating additional CSS files or extra <link rel="stylesheet"> tags.
	If you need global tweaks, keep them small and documented below.
