  Renders all visible fields of a Django form using the form_field partial.
  Expected context:
  - form: Django Bound Form

  Notes:
  - For radio/checkbox groups, consider using components/choice_group.html for better semantics.
  - You can still override per-field classes by including form_field directly instead of this helper. {% endcomment %}

{% for f in form.visible_fields %}
  {% include "components/form_field.html" with field=f label=f.label help=f.help_text %}
{% endfor %}
